(Bass) guitar processor Adau1761 chip. Linear input and low ohm headphones output are used.
Enough to play very different sound from jazz till extreme metall.
Some effects (like pitcher) have too long delay to play realtime, but every effect can be bypassed.
On chip RAM is full enough, so realization of another features like echo or wah-wah will be later.
